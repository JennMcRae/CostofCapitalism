# CostofCapitalism
A tool to find out what capitalism is costing you in real dollars and cents

## Description
The **Cost of Capitalism Calculator** estimates the annual costs of systemic harm (e.g., polycrisis costs, unpaid care work, survival expenses) and contrasts it with individual income, providing a tangible estimate of the "cost of survival" and the imbalance of economic systems.

This is an early working prototype based on publicly available data and assumptions, subject to further refinement. Currently it is using $CAD and v1 is for Canadians only (feel free to adjust currency to your home Nation). 

## How to Use
1. Select your **gender**.
2. Select your **age group**.
3. Enter your **annual income (CAD)**.
4. Click **Calculate** to see the total annual cost.

## Methodology
The calculator sums three main components:
1. **Polycrisis Cost:** $14,175 CAD per year per citizen (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services)
2. **Opportunity Cost of Unpaid Household Work:**
   - Male: $19,856 CAD/year (Stats Can) 
   - Female & Nonbinary: $36,006 CAD/year (Stats Can) 
3. **Annual Cost of Survival:** $58,014 CAD/year (2024 Living Wage Metro Vancouver, Stats Can)

Your income is subtracted from these systemic costs to produce an estimate of the imbalance.

This tool uses approximations and assumptions based on available data (2024). It is a conceptual tool and not intended for precise financial advice.
